# Mutable JSX

Based on mobx-jsx https://github.com/ryansolid/mobx-jsx . Was taken as base to understand DOM Expressions and possibly make something new with it. The idea is to create a Reactive library focused on mutability. The file to edit for that goal is src/lib.js. The TypeScript of that file has been converted to JavaScript.
